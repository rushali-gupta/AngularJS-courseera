    <h3>Prototypal Inheritance in JS is based on object instances ranther than classes.</h3>
    <h3>"Controller1 as ctrl", by doing this, we are not defining 
        properties directly on $scope but to $scope.ctrl property/object. (to avoid masking) 
    </h3>
    <li>Property is inherited from parent, looked up through prototype chain</li>
    <li>Property is local if  it is declared on the child with the same name as the parent and is therefore
        masking parent's property.
    </li>
    <h3>$scope is based on Prototypal Inheritance</h3>
    <li>
        Child controller's $scope is inherited from parent controller's $scope.
    </li>

    <h4>If we use "Controller as" syntax, i.e., Controller1 as ctrl,
        ctrl is a reference to 'this', (the instance of Controller1), because .controller treats
        controller function as function contrustor.
        this attaches properties to this inside Controller, not $scope, so no masking occurs.
